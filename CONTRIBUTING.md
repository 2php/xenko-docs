Contributing
============

## Process

If you plan to add content, submit an suggestion issue so that we can make sure it would fit well in the documentation and doesn't overlap with in-progress work.

## Building locally

1. Checkout both https://github.com/SiliconStudio/xenko and this repository in the same folder (API doc will be built from ../xenko).
2. Run build.bat to build the doc.
3. Run run_local_website.bat which will allow you to view the doc in your browser (page should automatically open).
4. Every time you want to see your latest changes, run again build.bat or build_manual_only.bat (faster), and refresh your browser (no need to run run_local_website.bat again).
