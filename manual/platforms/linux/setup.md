# Environment

The following instructions are written assuming the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS release because this is the Xenko team is using to develop the Unix version of Xenko. We are not strictly dependent on this version of Ubuntu, therefore any later versions or any other Linux distributions should also work as long you apply the instructions adapted to your environment.

# Setup

You will need the following packages:
* .NET Core
* SDL2
* FreeType
* BulletC
