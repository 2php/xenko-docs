>**Note:** Select the **Close the launcher after starting Xenko** check box to close the launcher after Game Studio starts. 


## Version management

With Xenko launcher, you can manage the various versions of the Xenko Software Development Kit (SDK).

Following are the version types of Xenko:

 * **Major**: This update to the software adds significant changes to the program. In a Major version, the first digit of the version is changed; for example, 1.x.x is changed to 2.x.x.
 * **Minor**: This update to the software adds minor changes to the program. In a Minor version, the second digit of the version is changed; for example, 1.1.x is changed to 1.2.x.
 * **Bug fix**: This is a change made to the software to fix bugs or problems found in the software. In a Bug fix version, the third digit of the version is changed; for example, 1.1.1 is changed to 1.1.2.

Xenko launcher allows you to choose the Xenko version because breaking changes may occur between versions and you may not necessarily want to update your game.

>**Note:** The bug fix version updates cannot be reverted.

After the Xenko installation is over for all the available versions, click the required version. You can see the selected version on the Start button. Click the Start button. The respective version of Game Studio is launched.

In the **Switch/update version** section, you can:

 * Click the Release Notes button to view the release notes of a Xenko  version.
 * Click the Download and Install button to install a Xenko version
 * Click the Uninstall button to uninstall a Xenko version.

## Visual Studio plugin

After you install Xenko, Xenko launcher opens automatically. First time, it prompts you to install the Xenko Visual Studio plugin. Installation of this plugin is not mandatory. However, we recommend you to install it. Using this plugin, you can edit your @shaders directly from Visual Studio.

This plugin provides the following:

 * Syntax highlighting
 * Live-code-analysis with validation
 * Error-checking
 * Navigation (jump to definition)

 If you manually remove the Visual Studio plugin, you can install it again by clicking the Reinstall button.
