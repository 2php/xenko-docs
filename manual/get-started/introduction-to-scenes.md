# Introduction to Scenes

A scene is a blank canvas, on which you can add entities. Entities refer to the objects that you added to your scene. 

The following image displays a sample scene with a single Knight and default elements, such as light, background, and other default entities.

## Overview

Game Studio provides an easy way to create scenes for your game. You can add existing assets, create assets from the existing Xenko templates, or you can import assets from external packages or games. In the scene, you can move around, rotate, and resize your assets very easily and intuitively.

When you create a new project, the Scene Editor displays your scene with the default elements, such as light, camera, skybox, and an entity. By default, youâ€™ll see the Sphere entity in the scene. You can start adding the required entities for your game.

This section will discuss the following subjects:

* [Navigate in the Scene Editor](navigate-in-the-editor.md) - how to move and look around.
* [Populate a scene](populate-a-scene.md) - how to put Assets in your Scene.
* [Arrange entites](arrange-entities.md) - how to move / rotate / scale your entities.

If you're looking for more advanced topics, see [Scenes](/manual/game-studio/scenes.md) in the Game Studio documentation.

To learn more about basic Scene concepts, see [Scene navigation](navigate-in-the-editor.md).
