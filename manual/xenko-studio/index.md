# Xenko Studio

A central place to start developing your game with Xenko, the Paradox Studio is helping to fully manage your assets:

- You can import your assets, modify their parameters and see changes in real-time in the preview window.
- You can organize your assets by folders, attach tags and get notifications from modified assets on the disk.
- You can also build a game executable and run it directly from it.

It makes it easy to work in a team with the same assets management experience.

For game developers, the editor is also tightly integrated with your Visual Studio projects enabling to seamlessly sync and switch back-and-forth.

## Samples

Xenko is coming with a set of technical samples for each engine parts (2D, 3D, Sprites, Fonts, UI, Audio, Input...) and a set of small games to help you boostrap into making your own game.
