# Texture

A texture simply means an image to define the characteristics of a surface, with an implicit tactile quality. For example, a rock texture should give the impression of the surface of a rock, and based on the type, a rough or smooth tactile quality. Various textures can be applied to an asset in your game. Xenko provides default textures that you can import and apply to your assets.
