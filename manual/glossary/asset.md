An asset is the representation of a game object inside the editor. Using asset you can configure the objects of your game.For example, images, music, sounds, and 3D files.

Xenko provides a flexible method to handle  assets. Assets can be added, created, and modified easily. Assets can be compiled and optimized easily with a special compiler provided by Xenko. The compiled assets are packed together as bundles and can be reused.
