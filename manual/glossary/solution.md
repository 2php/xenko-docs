# Solution

In Xenko Studio, the Solution explorer displays the hierarchy of your game. The content of each package is grouped into two categories: Local packages and External packages. Local packages are the ones that you have created. External packages are the one that you have downloaded from the Internet; for example, the default Xenko package. If you open a package file (.xkpkg), a single package of the local package category is visible. If you open a solution file (.sln) and the solution contains more that one package, you can see several packages.
