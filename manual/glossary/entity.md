# Entity

An entity is an object of a scene. Any object in a scene, such as, a ball, character, ground, camera, and many other objects is called an entity. All the objects that are added from Asset view to Scene editor are called entities. Each entity can have additional functionalities or behaviours called components. The entity can be modified at runtime by adding or removing a component.
