# Audio

The audio system is composed of two different APIs:

- A **high level API** called the [AudioSystem](audiosystem.md) that provides automatic 3D localization and audio updates based on the [Entity System](../engine/entity-component-model/index.md).
- A **low level API** called the [AudioEngine](audioengine.md) that provides a precise control on Audio output.
