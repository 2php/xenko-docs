# Physics

This section will discuss the following subjects:

* [Rigid body](rigid-body.md)
* [Static collider](static-collider.md)
* [Triggers](triggers.md)

The Xenko engine provides you with tools to realistically simulate physics in your game or application. The Xenko Physics engine simulates forces such as gravity and collision in a natural convincing way. With the built-in components it's easy to enable physics for your entities and allow them to interact with eachother.

This section will show you how to enable physics in Game Studio, how to use the correct physics component for your needs, and how to apply forces to an Entity through scripting. We will also show you how to use triggers, which allow you to trigger an event when an object enters a certain space for instance.
