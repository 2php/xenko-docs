# Rigid body

Rigid body simulation refers to the simulation of physics for objects that do not deform. Rigid body simultation can be used for collision between objects, and for objects that need to repsond to incoming collisions.

**To enable rigid body simulation for an entity:**

1. Starty Game Studio with the empty Game project

2. Select the Sphere in the Scene Editor

3. Click 'Add component' in the Property grid

4. Select 'Rigidbody'

5. Now find the created Rigidbody in the 'Property grid', and expand to view the Rigidbody properties

6. Select the '+' icon behind 'Collider Shapes' and select 'Sphere'


Now you've created a Rigidbody for a sphere, the spehere and ground plane are ready to interact with eachother.
