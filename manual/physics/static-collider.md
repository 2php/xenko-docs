# Static collider

A static collider is an object that itself is not affected by forces like gravity or collision and therefore doesn't move (i.e. static), but does affect rigid body objects when they collide with it. This type of collider is typically used for static game objects such as a wall or a floor object.

**To create a static collider:**

1. Starty Game Studio with the empty Game project

2. Select the ground (gray plane) in the Scene Editor

3. Click 'Add component' in the Property grid

4. Select 'Static collider'

5. Now find the created static collider in the 'Property grid', and expand to view the collider properties

6. Select the '+' icon behind 'Collider Shapes' and select 'Infinite Plane'


Now you've created a static collide for the ground plane in the empty Game Studio project, which allows other physics objects to interact with.
