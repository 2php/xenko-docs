# Introduction to Assets

An asset is a representation of an object or resource inside the editor, such as a model, a texture, a material, or an animation. Assets are the building blocks of your game and therefore creating and managing assets is an essential part of game creation.

This section will show you how to create Assets and the basics of Asset management.

You can create Assets by using the **Add asset** button or by directly dragging and dropping files in the Game Studio.

With the Asset view you can easily organize, search and visualize your Assets. Assets can be dragged and dropped in the Scene editor to start using them. Properties of the Asset can be set through the property grid in the top-left in Game Studio.
