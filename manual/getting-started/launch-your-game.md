# Launch your game

After your game is ready, you will be curious to see what your game looks like outside the Game studio. You can launch your game either on [Game Studio](xref:game-studio) or in Visual Studio.

In this page, youâ€™ll learn various ways to launch your game.

Xenko has an integrated IDE which automatically opens your game in Visual Studio and allows you to write your script. This saves your time to open a project and create from scratch in Visual Studio.

## Run your Game in Game Studio

In Game Studio, you can run your game either through the Play icon or through Live Scripting.

### Run your game using the play icon
