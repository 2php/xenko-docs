# Create a basic scene

You must create a [scene](xref:scene) to place various entities of your game on the scene. After that, you need to add or modify their properties in order to make them work the way you expect.

In this page, you’ll learn how to create a basic scene in [Game Studio] (xref:game-studio).

When you create a new [project](xref:project), a scene is created with default entities. You can complete your basic scene in two simple steps: First, you need to add the required [entities](xref:entity) to the scene. Second, execute your scene. 

>**Note:** Before you create a scene, you need to create or import some [assets](xref:asset) to your game. For information about creating or importing assets, see [Create and import assets](create-and-import-assets.md).

## Add entities to a scene

You can quickly add an entity to your scene from the **Asset view** tab. Select an entity from the **Asset view** tab, drag and place the entity on the [Scene Editor](xref:scene-editor). You can add entities, such as a [model](xref:model), [prefab](xref:prefab), and [texture](xref:texture). For more information on how to add entities to your scene, see [Add entities to a scene](add-entities-to-a-scene.md).

The following image displays a sample basic scene in the Scene Editor. You can see a Knight with default entities, such as camera, light, and others.

>**Note:** When you add a new entity, Game Studio adds the corresponding [components](xref:component), such as model, texture, and other entities automatically to your game. You can modify the default configurations of your entity. For information on how to configure your entities, see [Edit assets](edit-assets.md).

## Execute a scene

You’ve added the required entities to your scene. Now, you can execute your scene to launch your game and preview the scene. Executing a scene displays the actual view of the scene. You can change the position of the camera or add additional effects to your scene after previewing.

Click the ![Play button](media/create-a-basic-scene-play-button.png) button that appears below the Menu bar or press **F5**. This action builds the game and launches your game.

The following image displays an executed sample game scene.

You’ve created a simple game scene. Now, you need to add entities to your scene. For information about how to add entities to a scene, see [Add entities to a scene](add-entities-to-a-scene.md).
