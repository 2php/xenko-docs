# Create a basic scene

*** Add tutorial how to create a basic scene: add object, add ligth, add camera ***

*** Merge with Add entities to a scene ***

You must create a [scene](xref:scene) to place various entities of your game in the scene. After that, you need to add or modify their properties in order to make them work the way you expect.

This page will show how to create a basic scene in [Game Studio] (xref:game-studio).

>**Note:** Before you create a scene, you need to create or add some [assets](xref:asset) to your game. For information about creating or importing assets, see [Create and add assets](create-and-add-assets.md).

## Add entities to a scene

You can quickly add an entity to your scene from the **Asset view** tab. Select an entity from the **Asset view** tab, drag and place the entity on the [Scene Editor](xref:scene-editor). You can add entities, such as a [model](xref:model), [prefab](xref:prefab), and [texture](xref:texture). For more information on how to add entities to your scene, see [Add entities to a scene](add-entities-to-a-scene.md).

The following image displays a sample basic scene in the Scene Editor. You can see a Knight with default entities, such as camera, light, and others.

>**Note:** When you add a new entity, Game Studio adds the corresponding [components](xref:component), such as model, texture, and other entities automatically to your game. You can modify the default configurations of your entity. For information on how to configure your entities, see [Edit assets](edit-assets.md).

## Building and running the game

You’ve added the required entities to your scene. Now, you can build and run the game and view what the scene looks like. You can change the position of the camera or add additional effects to your scene after reviewing in the Game Studio.

Click the ![Play button](media/create-a-basic-scene-play-button.png) button that appears below the Menu bar or press **F5**. This action builds the game and starts your game.
