# Xenko launcher

After you install Xenko, the first window that opens on your system is the [Xenko launcher](xref:xenko-launcher). The launcher is the starting point of Xenko. It allows you to manage and select the versions of Xenko.

In this page, you’ll learn the basics of Xenko launcher.

The following image displays the **Xenko launcher**.

## Install and start your first Game Studio version

The launcher prompts you initially to install latest version as well as the Visual Studio plugin. Using this plugin, you can edit your [shaders](xref:shaders) directly from Visual Studio. This plugin provides the features of syntax highlighting, live-code-analysis with validation, error-checking, and navigation (jump to definition). It is not mandatory to install this plugin. However, we recommend you to install it.

You can start the currently displayed version of Game Studio by clicking the Start button. To change the starting version, click a version in the **Switch/update** version section to make the selected version as your current version.

## Manage Xenko versions

You can switch to another version of Xenko or update your current version of Xenko from the **Switch/update version** section. Xenko has major, minor, and bugs fix version types. The launcher allows you to choose the Xenko version because breaking changes (changes in API or features or behaviors of the game engine) may occur between versions and you may not necessarily want to update your game.
