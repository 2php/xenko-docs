After you install Xenko, the first window that opens on your system is the [Xenko launcher](xref:xenko-launcher). The launcher lets you manage te different versions that have been installed on your system.

## Install and start your first Game Studio version

The launcher prompts you initially to install latest version as well as the Visual Studio plugin. Using this plugin, you can edit your [shaders](xref:shaders) directly from Visual Studio. This plugin provides the features of syntax highlighting, live-code-analysis with validation, error-checking, and navigation (jump to definition). It is not mandatory to install this plugin. However, we recommend you to install it.

You can start the currently displayed version of Game Studio by clicking the Start button. To change the starting version, click a version in the **Switch/update** version section to make the selected version as your current version.

## Manage Xenko versions

You can switch to another version of Xenko or update your current version of Xenko from the **Switch/update version** section. The launcher also allows you to choose which Xenko version(s) you want to have installed on your machine. Versions might not be compatible with each other, and therefore the version of Xenko for which the project was developed for, should be installed. This allows for projects that have been developed with different versions to keep working, without the need to upgrade them to a newer version.

>**Note:** It is possible to upgrade projects that have been developed for older versions of Xenko, however manual changes might be needed to get the project working for a newer version. **Be sure to make a backup of your project and all related files before upgrading.**

Xenko version numbers consists of 3 numbers, separated by dots: Major.Minor.Build. Versions that contain _only_ bug fixes, only have a different Build number (The Major.Minor part is the same). We highly recommend you update your version to the version with the latest Build number might one be available.
