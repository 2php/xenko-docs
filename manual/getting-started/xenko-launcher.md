The launcher lets you manage te different versions that have been installed on your system. The [Xenko launcher](xref:xenko-launcher) helps you manage and start the various versions of [Game Studio](xref:game-studio).

## Installing Xenko and starting the Game Studio

The launcher prompts you initially to the install latest version of Xenko as well as the Visual Studio plugin. Using this plugin, you can edit your [shaders](xref:shaders) directly from Visual Studio. This plugin provides the features of syntax highlighting, live-code-analysis with validation, error-checking, and navigation. It is not mandatory to install this plugin, however we recommend to install it.

You can start the active version of Game Studio by clicking the Start button. To change the active version, click a version in the **Switch/update** version section to make the selected version, your active version.

## Version management

You can switch to another version of Xenko or update your current version of Xenko from the **Switch/update version** section. The launcher also allows you to choose which Xenko version(s) you want to have installed on your machine. Versions might not be compatible with each other, and therefore the version of Xenko for which a project was developed, should be installed. This allows for projects that have been developed with different versions to keep working, without the need to upgrade them to a newer version.

If only the last number in the version number is changed, it means that it is a bug fix version only, and it does not contain changes that will break projects build on a previous version. It is safe and recommended to install these big fix versions. Note that these versions cannot be reverted.

After the Xenko installation has finished for the selected versions, click the required version. You can see the selected version on the Start button. Click the Start button. The selected version of Game Studio is launched.
