# Project organization

A proper project organization is an important aspect of any game project. By learning how a Xenko project is organized, you can optimize your game development effort, time, and asset utilization.

In this page, you'll learn how a Xenko project is organized.

In Xenko, a @project refers to a game project. A Xenko project folder comprises of various sub-folders. Various project components are placed in the respective folders for easy access.  Each game is contained in a @package. In [game Studio](xref:game-studio), the Solution explorer section displays the hierarchy of your game. [Assets](xref:asset) are the objects used in your game. [Resources](xref:resources) are images, textures, and @entity images used in your game.

The hierarchy of game projects in Xenko is as follows:

* [Package](engine/package.md) 
* [Project](engine/project.md)
* [Solution](engine/solution.md)
* [Assets](engine/assets.md)
* [Resources](engine/resources.md)

Now, as you know how to organize your project, you can start creating your own assets. For more information about assets, see [Asset creation](asset-creation.md).
