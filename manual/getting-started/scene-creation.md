# Scene creation

In this section, you’ll learn how to create and execute a basic [scene](xref:scene) in Xenko; how to move around your scene using navigation controls, navigation gizmos, and camera settings; how to add [entities](xref:entity) to your scene in various ways; and how to move, rotate, and resize entities in your scene.

A scene is a blank canvas, on which you can add [assets](xref:asset), environment, and decorations to your game. Assets refer to the objects that you added to your scene. Environment and decorations in a game refer to the various effects that you add to your scene, such as background, lighting, audio, and animations.

Xenko provides an easy way to create scenes for your game. You don’t need to put a lot of effort in creating graphics or adding effects. You can add existing assets, create assets from the existing Xenko templates, or you can import assets from external [packages](xref:package) or games. On the scene, you can move around, rotate, and resize your assets so easily, that you'll definitely love working with Xenko.

When you create a new project, the Scene Editor displays your scene with the default entities, such as light, camera, background, and an entity. By default, you’ll see the Sphere entity in the scene. You can start adding the required entities for your game. To know how to add entities to your game, see [Add entities to a scene](add-entities-to-a-scene.md).

The following image displays a sample scene with a single Knight and default effects, such as light, background, and other default entities.
