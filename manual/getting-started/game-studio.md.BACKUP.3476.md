# Game Studio

The Game Studio is the central tool for game production. Its main purpose is to create and manage content for your game, but it also allows you to configure, preview and launch your game.

This page will introduce you to the different views and tabs of Game Studio.

_Game Studio_

In the following sections, each section and tab of Game Studio is explained briefly.

## Asset Editors 

The center of the Game Studio window is dedicated to asset editors. Asset editors are used to edit specific properties of asset. Each asset type has its specific editor, which will be activated once the asset has been selected. In the above image the Scene Editor, which allows you to manipulate and edit elements in the scene, is active.

## Property grid

The **Property grid** section displays the properties of the selected [asset](xref:asset) or property. From this tab, you can modify all the properties of your game elements. You can find this tab at the upper-right of the studio window.

## Solution explorer

The **Solution explorer** tab displays the hierarchy of all the elements of your game. It helps you browse your assets, code files, [packages](xref:package) and dependencies. You can modify the hierarchy by creating folders or objects, renaming or deleting objects, and other functions.

## Asset view

You can find this tab at the bottom-center of the Studio. This tab displays all the assets of your game; you can change the view to thumbnail view or more compact grid view. You can create new assets from New Asset button, and you can drag and drop assets from the Asset view to the Scene Editor. 

### Asset preview

This tab displays an asset preview based on the lighting, camera, and other parameters of your scene. You can playback animations and sounds in the preview. The preview depends on the type of the asset you selected. You can find this tab at the bottom-right of the Studio.

Now youâ€™re familiar with Game Studio interface, you can start organizing your project. To know more about organizing your project, see [Project structure](game-project-structure.md).
