# Scene creation

This section will discuss the following subjects:

* [Scene navigation](scene-navigation.md) - how to move and look around.
* [Populating your scene](populating-your-scene.md) - how to put Assets in your Scene.
* [Positioning entites](positioning-entities.md) - how to move / rotate / scale your entities.

<small>If you're looking for more advanced topics, see [Scenes](/manual/game-studio/scenes.md) in the Game Studio documentation.</small>

A scene is a blank canvas, on which you can add entities. Entities refer to the objects that you added to your scene. 

Xenko provides an easy way to create scenes for your game. You can add existing assets, create assets from the existing Xenko templates, or you can import assets from external [packages](xref:package) or games. In the scene, you can move around, rotate, and resize your assets very easily and intuitively.

When you create a new project, the Scene Editor displays your scene with the default elements, such as light, camera, skybox, and an entity. By default, youâ€™ll see the Sphere entity in the scene. You can start adding the required entities for your game.

The following image displays a sample scene with a single Knight and default elements, such as light, background, and other default entities.
