# Create Assets

To add content to your game, you need to import assets. This page will show you how to import assets in [Game Studio](xref:game-studio).

Xenko provides the following ways to create and add assets in your game:
 * Add assets from the **Asset view** tab
 * Add assets by dragging and dropping resource files (images, audio, etc.) in the **Asset view** tab
 
##Adding assets from the Asset view tab

 1. In the **Asset view** tab, click ![New asset](media/create-and-add-assets-add-new-asset-button.png).
 
	A list of assets is displayed.

 2. Click an asset, for example, [Procedural Model](xref:procedural-model).

	The asset is added to the **Asset view** tab.

> **Note**: Some Assets require a source file, such as textures. When adding these Assets, you will be prompted to select the required resource file in order to continue.	

##Adding assets with drag and drop

You can also add Assets by dragging and dropping files directly from the Windows explorer into the **Asset view** tab.

After the asset is added to the **Asset view** tab, move your mouse pointer over the asset to see the URL, Type, and other details of the asset as a tooltip.
