# Getting started

This part of the manual gets you started making a basic, runnable project as fast and painless as possible in 3 easy steps:  
1. Check [install xenko](howto-install-xenko.md) to install the Xenko engine if you haven't already  
2. Create your [first project ](howto-create-and-setup-new-game.md)  
3. And set up your [first basic scene](howto-create-and-setup-new-game.md) in the project
 
Afterwards you can [learn more about the Xenko suite](../xenko-suite/index.md) and find out how to [import assets and create scripts](../workflow/index.html)  
For more in-depth Xenko [engine specific topics look here](../project-and-architecture/index.md)

If you are stuck or have other questions make sure to check our Q&A site [Answers](http://answers.xenko.com/)
