# Getting started

This part of the manual gets you started making a basic, runnable project as fast and painless as possible in 3 easy steps:
1. Check [install xenko](http://xenko.com/download/) to install the Xenko engine if you haven't already  
2. Create your [first project](howto-create-and-setup-new-game.md)  
3. And [import your first asset](howto-create-or-import-asset-data.md) in the project
 
Afterwards you can learn more about the [GameStudio](game-studio-interface.md), [project structure](game-project-hierarchy.md) and find out [how to script](howto-use-scripts.md).

For more in-depth [engine specific topics look here](../engine/index.md).
