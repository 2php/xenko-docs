# Game Studio

The Game Studio is the central tool for game and application production. Its main purpose is to create and manage content for your game, but it also allows you to configure, preview and launch your game.

This page will introduce you to the different views and tabs of Game Studio.

## Asset Editors 

The center of the Game Studio window is dedicated to asset editors. Some asset types have their specific editor. If there is an editor available for the asset type, it can be opened by double clicking the asset, or right clicking the asset and selecting 'Edit asset' in the context menu. In the above image, the Scene Editor, which allows you to manage elements in the scene, is active.

## Property grid

The **Property grid** section displays the properties of the selected asset or entity. From this tab, you can modify all the properties of your game elements. You can find this tab at the upper-right of the Game studio window.

## Solution explorer

The **Solution explorer** tab displays the hierarchy of all the elements of your game. It helps you browse your assets, code files, [packages](xref:package) and dependencies. In this view you can create folders and objects, rename them and move them around.

>**Note**: All assets are placed in the 'Asset' folder of the solution, and all code (script) files should be put in the assembly they are part of.

## Asset view

You can find this tab at the bottom-center of the Game studio. This tab displays all the assets of your game; you can change the view to thumbnail view or more compact grid view. You can create new assets with the New Asset button, and you can drag and drop assets from the Asset view to the Scene Editor. You can also drag and drop files directly into the Asset view to automatically create Assets from these files.

### Asset preview

This tab displays a preview of the selected asset, you can playback animations and sounds in the preview for instance. The preview changes based on the type of the asset you have selected. The Asset preview tab gives you a quick and convenient preview of settings you change for this Asset in the 'Property grid'. You can find this tab at the bottom-right of the Game studio.

Now youâ€™re familiar with the Game Studio interface, you can start organizing your project, see [Project structure](project-structure.md).
