# Game Studio

The Game Studio is the central tool for game and application production. Its main purpose is to create and manage content for your game, but it also allows you to configure, preview and launch your game.

This page will introduce you to the different views and tabs of Game Studio.

## Asset Editors 

The center of the Game Studio window is dedicated to asset editors. Asset editors are used to edit specific properties of an asset. Each asset type has its specific editor, which will be activated once the asset has been selected. In the above image, the Scene Editor, which allows you to manipulate and edit elements in the scene, is active.

## Property grid

The **Property grid** section displays the properties of the selected asset or entity. From this tab, you can modify all the properties of your game elements. You can find this tab at the upper-right of the Game studio window.

## Solution explorer

The **Solution explorer** tab displays the hierarchy of all the elements of your game. It helps you browse your assets, code files, [packages](xref:package) and dependencies. In this view you can create folder and objects, rename and move them around.

## Asset view

You can find this tab at the bottom-center of the Game studio. This tab displays all the assets of your game; you can change the view to thumbnail view or more compact grid view. You can create new assets from New Asset button, and you can drag and drop assets from the Asset view to the Scene Editor. 

### Asset preview

This tab displays an asset preview based on the lighting, camera, and other parameters of your scene. You can playback animations and sounds in the preview. The preview changes based on the type of the asset you have selected. You can find this tab at the bottom-right of the Game studio.

Now youâ€™re familiar with the Game Studio interface, you can start organizing your project. To know more about organizing your project, see [Project structure](game-project-structure.md).
