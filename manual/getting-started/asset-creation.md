# Asset creation

An asset is a representation of an object inside the editor, such as a model, a texture, a material, or an animation. Assets are the building blocks of your game and therefore creating and managing assets is an essential part of game creation.

This page will show you how to create new [assets](xref:asset) for your game and how to edit them.

Start creating your own assets or try using the sample assets of Xenko for your game. For more information about creating and adding assets, see [Create and add assets](create-and-add-assets.md).
