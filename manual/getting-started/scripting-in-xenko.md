# Scripting in Xenko

In this page, youâ€™ll learn how to use a [script](xref:scripting) in your game, types of scripts used in Xenko, and how to make the properties of your script appear in the Game Studio.

## Scripting and entities

A script is a unit of code that helps to move entities, control their movement, arrange events in your game, and respond to user inputs. All scripting in Xenko is done in C#, therefore you can use the C# programming reference, to find out about language specific information you might need.

A script can be attached to one or more entities. Multiple scripts can also be attached to a single entity. If you attach a script to multiple entities, multiple instances of that script are created. This allows for the same script to have different values for its public properties. You'll learn more about this subject later in this chapter.

Scripting allows you to control all elements of the game. There are a couple of Xenko specific base types from which you can derive your classes from, which you can use for functionality that needs to be called every frame, or just once at startup.

## Xenko specific types of scripts

Scripts can be classified into Startup scripts, Synchronous scripts, and Asynchronous scripts.

The following are the types of scripts with examples:

* **Startup script:** This script's ```Start``` method is called once during startup, and can be used to initialize certain game elements.

```
public class StartUpScriptExample : StartupScript
{
	public override void Start()
	{
		// Do some stuff during initialization
	}
}
```

* **Synchronous script:** The script's ```Update``` method is called each frame. Because the script is synchronous, execution of other scripts waits until the active script is done.

```
public class SampleSyncScript : SyncScript
{        
	public override void Update()
	{
		if (Game.IsRunning)
		{
			// Do some stuff every frame
		}
	}
}
```

* **Asynchronous script:** The script's ```Execute``` method is called each frame. Because the script is a-synchronous, execution of other scripts is not blocked.

```
public class SampleAsyncScript : AsyncScript
{        
	public override async Task Execute() 
	{
		while (Game.IsRunning)
		{
			// Do some stuff every frame
			await Script.NextFrame();
		}
	}
}
```

### Available Engine Modules

If a script is derived from either ```SyncScript``` or ```AsyncScript```, the script can access various Engine Modules of the Xenko framework:

* **Audio**: Gives access to the audio system.
* **Content**: Lets you load and save content from Assets.
* **EffectSystem**: Lets you load and compile effects and shaders.
* **Game**: 
* **GraphicsDevice**: Gives you very advanced access to the low-level graphics device, in order to create GPU resources.
* **Input**: Gives you access to keyboard, mouse and joypad states and event.
* **SceneSystem**: Gives you access to the currently displayed scene. Here you can manage Entities.
* **Log**: Gives you access to logging system, in order to log messages and errors from script.

These objects are described in more detail in the Xenko API reference.

## Using public properties

Public properties can be set from the Game Studio and allow to configure scripts with dynamic parameters from the Game studio. In order to use a public property in Game Studio, it needs to be serializable. 

The following is an example of a script with a public property called DelayTimeOut:

```cs
public class SampleSyncScript : SyncScript
{
	// Declared public member variables and properties will be shown in Game Studio
	public float DelayTimeOut { get; set; }
	
	public override void Update()
	{
		// Do some stuff every frame
	}
}
```

In the above example, the ```SampleSyncScript``` class exposes a public property called ```DelayTimeOut```.

If you need to have a public property in your script, that should be hidden in Game Studio, use the ```[DataMemberIgnore]``` attribute as follows:

```cs
public class SampleSyncScript : SyncScript
{
	// This public property will not be available in Game Studio
	[DataMemberIgnore]
	public float DelayTimeOut { get; set; }
	
	public override void Update()
	{
		// Do some stuff every frame
	}
}
```

### Steps to set a public property in Game Studio

In order to set a value in the public property in the ```SampleSyncScript```. You have to assign it to an entity first.

1. Open your game in Game Studio and select the entity you want to attach the script to.

2. In the **Property grid** section, click **Add Component**, and then select the script containing the public property. In our case the script is called **SampleSyncScript**.

3. The public property is displayed under the header 'SampleSyncScript' and can be set in the Property grid.
   Select the public property and change the value in ```DelayTimeOut```.
