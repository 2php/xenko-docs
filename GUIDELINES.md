## <a name="Tone"> Conversation Tone

#### Appropriate Style:
We want our documentation to have a conversational tone. You should feel as though you
are having a conversation with the author as you read any of our tutorials or explanations.
Your experience as a reader should be informal, conversational, and informative. You should
feel as though you are listening to the author explain the concepts to you.

#### Inappropriate Style:
One might see the contrast between a conversational style and the style one finds with
more academic treatments of technical topics. Those resources are very useful, but the authors
have written those articles in a very different style than our documentation. When one reads
an academic journal, one finds a very different tone and a very different style of writing.
One feels that they are reading a dry account of a very dry topic.  

The first paragraph above follows our recommendation conversational style. The second
is a more academic style. You see the difference immediately.
